\section{Annex}

Here we list all the delivered script and function files delivered for this practice.

We include relevant observations. For full insight, we refer the reader to the
source code.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{show\_results.m}: a method that takes a RGB image, an array of labels (one per
	each pixel of the image) and the
	centroids associated to each cluster (sorted from lowest label to greatest). It plots the
	original image, the labels with a grayscale colormap and the labels colored with
	the mean color of the cluster.
	\item \texttt{kmeans\_exercise.m}: script that executes the k-means algorithm once and plots
	the results. We have used this script to generate the plots of the first section of this
	document.
	\item \texttt{mshift\_exercise.m}: idem for Mean-shift algorithm
\end{itemize}
