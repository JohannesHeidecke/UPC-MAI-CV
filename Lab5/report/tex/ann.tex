\section{Annex}

Here we list all the delivered script and function files delivered for this practice.

We include relevant observations. For full insight, we refer the reader to the
source code.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{FD\_ex1.m}: code for the first section (Haar-like features and classification) of
	the assignment. The code has been completed to perform the required functionality.
	\item \texttt{FD\_ex2.m}: code for the second section (Apply and evaluate Viola \& Jones
	method on a video). Notice that only the 100 first frames of the video are processed as per
	indication in the comments of the source code (although this can be easily changed). Notice
	also that we create the \texttt{CascadeObjectDetector} specifying a minimum size of [50, 50]
	(this can be increased even further), because the faces in the video have a rather big size
	and this contributes to perform the computation more efficiently.
\end{itemize}
