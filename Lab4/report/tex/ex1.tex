\section{Feature matching}

\subsection{Question 1}

{\bfseries Modify the previous threshold. What is the effect of this
threshold? Comment your response.}

\subsection{Question 2}

{\bfseries Comment on the obtained result. Is the resulting model (more
or less) correct? By looking at the original images, do you think a linear model
is enough to model the transformation between the two images?}
