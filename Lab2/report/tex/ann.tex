\section{Delivered code files}

Here we list all the delivered script and function files delivered for this practice.
We include relevant observations. For full insight, we refer the reader to the
source code.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{exercise1.m}: version of \emph{exercise1} with UI controls
	\item \texttt{exercise1.m.old}: first version of \emph{exercise1}, with hardcoded parameters
	\item \texttt{exercise2.m}: method that plays a video with overlapped edges. The edge detector
	can be configured at runtime.
	\item \texttt{exercise2.m.old}: method that extracts a single frame from a video and extracts its
	edges using several detectors. The edges are then compared.
	\item \texttt{overlapEdges.m}: auxiliary function that overlaps edges to an image. The color of the
	edges can be specified.
	\item \texttt{rndColor.m}: auxiliary function for generating a random color. Used to decide a
	different color for the overlapped edges each time.
\end{itemize}
