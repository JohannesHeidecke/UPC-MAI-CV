\section{Gender recognition}

For this exercise we used a gender recognition system based on the AR-Face database. The used code and files are listed in appendix \ref{sec:ann}.

\subsection{Questions}

\question

\begin{itemize}
	\item Which is the information contained in ARFace.person?
	\item Why the size of the field internal, size(ARFace.internal), is $ 1188 \times 2210 $?
\end{itemize}

ARFace is a matlab struct. \texttt{ARFace.person} contains 2210 numeric values that link each 


\question

$ \bullet $ What are the variables '\texttt{n}' and '\texttt{index}' of the function \texttt{fold\_validation.m}?

\question

$ \bullet $ The function \texttt{main\_gender\_recognition.m} computes some evaluation measures obtained with `PCA'
($ dim= 5 $), `PCA95' (95\% variance explained) and `LDA'. Explain the meaning of these measures and discuss which is the best obtained result.
