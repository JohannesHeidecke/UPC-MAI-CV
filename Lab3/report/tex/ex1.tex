\section{Question 1}

{\bfseries Take at your own choice several keypoints that have been
detected at different scales. Using the theory given in the lectures, comment on
the reasons of why do you think that a keypoint has been detected at that position
and at that particular scale. You may repeat the experiment with another image
(such as 'river1') to understand what a significant keypoints is.}
