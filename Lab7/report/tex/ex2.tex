\section{Mean-shift segmentation}

The algorithm is not deterministic because at each update step the next
point to update (i.e. move towards the mean of its neighbourhood
centered in that point) is selected randomly. This is done in the 
line 47 of the provided \texttt{MeanShiftCluster.m} file
(\texttt{tempInd = ceil( (numInitPts-1e-6)*rand);}).
This also means that two executions of the Mean-shift algorithm do
not yield necessarily the same value
(unless the seed of the random generator is fixed).
