\section{Image binarization}

The built-in Matlab function \textit{imbinarize} creates a logical array for an grayscale image I given a threshold t in which all pixels with values above t get mapped to a 1 and all other pixels to a 0.

Figure \ref{fig:task19} shows binarizations for a gray scale image of a car for different thresholds. It can be seen that the optimum threshold depends heavily on the specific image. In this case, a threshold of 20 or 30 still maps most pixel to white values and does not yield a useful result. When moving the threshold closer to 1, most pixels get mapped to a white output, as the in the first image of figure \ref{fig:task19}. Conversely, for very high thresholds (like the extreme 255) maps almost every pixel to black.

Figure \ref{fig:task20} shows the pixel-wise product of the original image and its binarization with a threshold of 150/255.

Figure \ref{fig:task21} shows the pixel-wise product of the original image and its inverted binarization with a threshold of 150/255.
