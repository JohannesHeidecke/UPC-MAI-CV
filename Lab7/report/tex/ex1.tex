\section{k-means segmentation}

The algorithm may or may not be deterministic depending upon the choice of
parameters. The default initialization method, \emph{kmeans++}, is
stochastic (although it
applies a certain heuristic in order for having the initial cluster as far
apart as possible). The other named methods (\emph{sample}, \emph{uniform},
\emph{cluster}) are stochastic as well. There is an additional initialization
method which consists in accepting from the user a matrix with the clusters' centroids.
Should these clusters be decided deterministically the algorithm will perform
the same steps at each run.
