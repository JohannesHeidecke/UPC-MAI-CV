\section{Annex}

Here we list all the delivered script and function files delivered for this practice,
aside from those that were already provided to us.
We include relevant observations. For full insight, we refer the reader to the
source code.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{feature\_matching.m}: code for the first section (Feature Matching) of
	the assignment. The script is divided into several cells so they can be tested
	more conveniently.
	\item \texttt{panorama\_creation.m}: method that performs the functionality requested
	in the second section of the assignment (Panorama creation). The method accepts
	two image paths and three optional parameters: \texttt{M}, the number of
	RANDSAC iterations (default 100); \texttt{N}, the cardinality of the subset built at each
	RANDSAC iteration (default 10); and \texttt{epsilon}, how close has to be a point from the
	second image to its correspondence in the first image in order for it to be counted
	as a ``success'' by the RANDSAC algorithm (default 5 px).
\end{itemize}
